            CRM, which stands for Customer Relationship Management, refers to a
            strategic method of interacting with a company and its present and
            potential customers. It combines technology, processes, and data to
            efficiently operate sales, marketing, and consumer care.

            communication logs, etc. It is not merely a large database but a
            business operation backbone encouraging staff collaboration,
            automation of mundane tasks, and the construction of genuine
            camaraderie with its clientele.

            to make clear, goal-aligning decisions. In the end, it is a
